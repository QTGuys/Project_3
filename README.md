# Project 3 Deferred Shading

- The skeleton of the QT graphics engine has been changed in order to have directional lights and point lights in both forward and deferred rendering

### How to use
- Extract the zip and execute the .exe inside. Once we open a model from the Entity->Import model menu, press add entity and then add a light component to it
The lights are created in the 0 point of the world, so the user might have to move them in order for them to iluminate the scene.
